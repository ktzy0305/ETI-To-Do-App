# ETI CA2: To-Do App
This a basic To-Do application developed using Django following the Software Change Management process. We will be following the Disciplined Agile Development approach for this project.

## Important Things To Note
**Developer(s):**
PM will be assigning features to you all. Please do TDD approach by writing a failing unit test first, then enough production code to pass, then refactor and repeat the cycle. Once feature is completed and has passed your written unit tests, comment on the issue assigned to you: "Feature X is ready for testing" Please also remember mention the QA Tester @githubbing97. PM will create an issue for testing your feature.

**QA Tester(s):**
Your job is to verify that the above features are working through acceptance tests. You can do both manual and automated testing. There is a folder called _"QA"_ for you to write code for automated acceptance tests using PyTest and / or Selenium.
If any of your acceptance test case fails, please take a screenshot of the error and find the commit number by clicking on the commit tabs of the repository and also mention the developer. PM will be one to create ann issue to fix the bug.

## If anyone needs help
If you need help in coding, in debugging or web design for developers can don't hesitate to ask me to help. You can also create an issue for "Help Needed" as well on GitHub Issues. This also applies for the QA Testers if you need help in write code for automated tests.
